## Development with LangChain, Pandas and SQLite

In developing this prototype we used Python, due to its efficacy in building complex applications with relative ease. Python's rich ecosystem facilitated the integration of three crucial libraries: [**LangChain**](https://www.langchain.com),  [**Flask**](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/) and [**SQLite**](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html), each playing a pivotal role in our project.

### What is LangChain?

![langchain_logo](<langchain_logo.png>)

[**LangChain**](https://www.langchain.com) is a versatile open-source framework designed to build applications powered by large language models (LLMs). Our chatbot utilizes an LLM as a reasoning engine, which, in LangChain terminology, is referred to as an [**Agent**](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/agents/). This Agent is responsible for planning and executing actions based on user input.

For a deeper dive into how [**LangChain**](https://www.langchain.com) can be used to simplify the prototyping of AI applications, visit our blog post: [**AI Prototyping with LangChain and Streamlit**](https://philico-tech.github.io/ptech-blog/langchain/).
