In our pursuit of streamlining everyday business processes, we've tapped into the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to parse, correct, and clean unstructured data.

Our objective was clear â€“ to engineer an application capable of cleansing and structuring address data, while at the same time giving the end user the possibility of validating and editing the results.

## Development with SQLite, LangChain and Flask

In developing this prototype, we used Python, due to its efficacy in building complex applications with relative ease. Python's rich ecosystem facilitated the integration of three crucial libraries: [**SQLite**](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html), [**LangChain**](https://www.langchain.com) and [**Flask**](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/).

### What is SQLite?

<img src="sqlite_logo.png" width="45%" height="auto">

[**SQLite**](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) is an open-source database engine, widely acclaimed for its reliability, simplicity, and lightweight nature. Unlike traditional database systems that require a separate server process, [**SQLite**](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) is serverless and integrates directly into applications. 

This self-contained, file-based database engine provides a robust and efficient solution for managing data within the application itself. It's an ideal choice for applications that require a compact, portable database without the overhead of server management.

We used [**SQLite**](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) to create the database that stores the unstructured address data and the results of the AI processing.

### What is LangChain?

<img src="langchain_logo.png" width="60%" height="auto">

[**LangChain**](https://www.langchain.com) is a versatile open-source framework designed to build applications powered by large language models (LLMs). In our prototype, we used [**LangChain**](https://www.langchain.com) to send the unstructured data to the LLM, responsible for extracting the different parts of the address.

For a deeper dive into how [**LangChain**](https://www.langchain.com) can be used to simplify the prototyping of AI applications, visit our blog post: [**AI Prototyping with LangChain and Streamlit**](https://philico-tech.github.io/ptech-blog/langchain/).

### What is Flask?

<img src="flask_logo.png" width="45%" height="auto">

[**Flask**](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/) is a web application framework, known for its simplicity and efficiency. It excels in enabling rapid development and offers the scalability necessary for more complex applications.

In our project, we utilized [**Flask**](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/) to construct a user-friendly web application that allows the users to interact with, view, and edit the processed data returned by the AI.

## The dataflow

The diagram below illustrates the dataflow of the application:

![workflow](<workflow.png>)

The steps can be summarized as follows:

1. The unstructured address data is stored in a CSV file.

2. The CSV file is imported into the SQLite database.

3. The data is processed by the LLM and the results are sent to Google Maps API for validation.

4. The validated and structured address data is stored back in the SQLite database.

5. The data stored in the SQLite database is displayed in the web application for end-user manual validation and editing.

## The application in action

In order to demonstrate how the application works, we'll use a CSV file with the following unstructured address data:

![data_cleansing_2](data_cleansing_2.png)

When the application is executed, the first step consists of migrating the data from the CSV file to the SQLite database.

The second step consists of cleansing the data with the LLM and sending the results to the Google Maps API for validation. The following screenshot shows the results of the LLM processing, where the address that are successfully validated by the Google Maps API are highlighted.

The LLM demonstrates remarkable proficiency in identifying and extracting the various components of a complete address, including the resident's name, street name, street number, postal code, city, and country, along with other relevant details. Furthermore, it is capable of correcting typos and deducing missing elements like postal codes, cities, or countries.

The third step consists of displaying the results of the LLM processing to the end user. The following screenshot shows the front-end of the web application.

![data_cleansing_6](data_cleansing_6.png)

The end user can now validate the results and manually edit the data if necessary. When the end user clicks on the "Confirm" button, the data is stored back in the database.

![data_cleansing_5](data_cleansing_5.gif)

Address that have not been validated by the Google Maps API are highlighted in red. For these particular cases, the end user can fill in the data and trigger the Google Maps API validation process manually.

## Potential improvements

The addition of data visualization tools would allow for a more intuitive and user-friendly experience. In a future iteration, we could add the possibility of letting the user upload the CSV file with the unstructured data directly from the web application. Furthermore, we could add a dashboard with charts and graphs to visualize every step of the data cleansing process.

## Conclusion

The creation of our address cleansing application has been a practical exploration into the utility of AI in data management. By integrating SQLite, LangChain, and Flask, we've developed a tool that efficiently structures and cleanses address data, enhancing data accuracy.

This project has not only addressed a common business challenge but also showcased the potential of AI to simplify complex tasks in a straightforward and user-friendly manner.
